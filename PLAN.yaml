    title: Add Calculator class
    description: |
      Create a Calculator class in src/calculator.py that wraps all utility
      functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power) from src/utils.py.
      The class should:
        - Import and delegate to the functions in src/utils.py
        - Have methods: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power
        - Each method takes two arguments and returns the result
        - Include a `history` list attribute that records each operation as
          a dict with keys: operation, args, result
      Add comprehensive tests in tests/test_calculator.py covering:
        - Each Calculator method returns correct results
        - History is recorded correctly
        - ZeroDivisionError propagates from divide(x, 0)
